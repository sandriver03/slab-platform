Simple Examples
=======================================

FooDevice
-----------------------------------

A simple simulated Gaussian random number generating device. When running, this device will generate n streams of
Gaussian random numbers defined by parameter n_channel. The mean and std of the random number can be set through mu and
sigma.

The full code can be found in `FooDevice.py` under **examples/Devices** folder. Run the .py file in your python
interpreter to play with it.


FooExperiment
-----------------------------------

A simple experiment which uses the FooDevice. It runs multiple trials of fixed length with different Gaussian means,
collects the data from the FooDevice and save it to hard drive.

The full code can be found in `FooExperiment.py` under **examples/Experiments** folder. Run the .py file in your python
interpreter to play with it. Before start, put the `example.h5` file under **examples/Data** folder into the .subjects
folder of the LabPlatform path (you can get it using the `get_config` function from `labplatform.config`, using the key
`SUBJECT_ROOT`). By default on Windows, the default path will be C:/labplatform.
