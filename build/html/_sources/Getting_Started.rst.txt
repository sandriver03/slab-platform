Getting started
=======================================

There are two main parts to prepare for an experiment:

    1. A controller to control the experiment flow

    2. A (series of) controller to interact with hardware used in the experiment

For the experiment controller, you need to write a subclass of the :doc:`_Core_classes/ExperimentLogic` class. For
device controllers, subclassing the :doc:`_Core_classes/Device` class. Both of these classes use the
:doc:`_Core_classes/Setting` class to configure parameters involved; the experiment controller (subclass of
:doc:`_Core_classes/ExperimentLogic`) will also use the :doc:`_Core_classes/ExperimentData` class to save data to hard
drive.

Currently, the :doc:`_Core_classes/ExperimentData` class prepares data file in HDF5 format.
