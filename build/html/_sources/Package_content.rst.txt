Package organization
=======================================

The whole program folder is organized in to different sub-folders:

.. _PackageContent_Config-reference-label:

config
---------------------------------------

global settings used across the platform; e.g. file system, date/time format etc

    On windows, default path is C:\\labplatform. It is put this way so that the path is user-independent (but not
    convenient as on Desktop)

    On Mac/Linx, default path is ~user/labplatform. Probably a bad idea since it is user specific

core
---------------------------------------

Important base components of the platform, including:

    **Data**: class handling data operation in experiment
            #ToDo: right now all data channels are the same type (either RAM or File).
            Should allow different type of backend to be used for each channel

        - Writer: (continuously and syn/asynchronously) write data into storage

    **Logic**: controller class handling experiment/device as well as GUI interaction

        - Device: base class operating hardware

        - ExperimentLogic: base class operating experiments

    **subject**: class storing all relevant information about experiment subject

    **ToolBar**: GUI interface to different actions perform by Device/ExperimentLogic

GUI
---------------------------------------

GUI elements, mostly notably (semi)real-time data displays.

stream
---------------------------------------

Information communication/exchange using sockets. Its purpose is mainly to run inter processes/threads communications

utilities
---------------------------------------

Helpers, low-level classes and functions generally not directly used when writing new devices and experiments

        channel: interface to RAM buffer and HDF5 storage
