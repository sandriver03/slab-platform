Note and ToDo list
=======================================

1). implement a general thread support in Logic
    - done; seems working

2). change method 'stop' to 'pause' and 'terminate' to 'stop'
    - done, seems working

3). implement pause in ExperimentLogic so that pause only works when trial is not running
    - done, not tested

4). implement proper stop method for ExperimentLogic
    - done, seems working

5). implement general-purpose process_event method in ExperimentLogic
    - done, seems working

6). implement trial timer and experiment timer to control non-fixed duration experiments

7). testing module

8). currently configure() method cannot be called while logic is running. do we need to change it?
    - now parameters with context=False can be configured during running

9). the hdf5 file seems prone to corruption. need to find a solution
    - maybe change the data backend from pytables to h5py
