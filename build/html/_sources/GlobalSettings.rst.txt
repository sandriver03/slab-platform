Global configurations for the `labplatform` package
====================================================

Global configurations are managed by the `config` subpackage. The default settings are defined in .config.settings,
which includes information such as where to located computer- and user- specific settings, where to find the hardware
related files (e.g. .rcx files for TDT system), subject cohorts information, where to save data, so on and so forth.
The package will create corresponding dirs to hold relevant information if the dirs do not exist.

To load the settings, simply import the subpackage::

    from labplatform import config

This will first load the defaults, and then load the jason file `{computername}_{user}_{general}.json` in the setting
file folder, if available. The information in the jason file is used to update the default settings.

You can use the `get_config` to check current settings. To modify a setting, use `set_config`. You can save the modified
configuration environment to a jason file using `save_env_config`, and load the saved configuration with
'load_env_config'.

Most time you do not need to modify/save/load configuration files, in this case you only need the `get_config` function.
Therefore, you can simply do::

    from labplatform.config import get_config
